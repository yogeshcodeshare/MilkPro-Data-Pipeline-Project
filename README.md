# MilkPro-Data-Pipeline-Project  #

## Introduction: ##
	The "MilkPro Data Pipeline" is a data engineering project that aims to build a scalable and real-time data pipeline for processing and analyzing milk properties data. The project leverages PySpark and Kafka to handle data streaming and incorporates various parameters such as id, fat_percentage, protein_percentage, lactose_percentage, temperature, farm id, timestamp, supplier id, locations, environmental conditions, batch id, and pH level. The project addresses specific business scenarios related to milk categorization based on fat percentage and location-based data segregation, with an error handling mechanism for bad data.

# Project Details:
Business Objective: The "MilkPro Data Pipeline" is a comprehensive data engineering project aimed at building a scalable and real-time data pipeline for processing and analyzing milk properties data. The project incorporates various parameters to capture key information related to milk samples, including id, fat_percentage, protein_percentage, lactose_percentage, temperature, farm id, timestamp, supplier id, locations, environmental conditions, batch id, and pH level. By considering these parameters, the project enables in-depth analysis and investigation into milk quality control, enzymatic activity, and process optimization.

# Parameters:
The project incorporates the following parameters for analysis:
1.	Id: Unique identifier for each milk sample.
2.	Fat_percentage: Percentage of fat content in the milk.
3.	Protein_percentage: Percentage of protein content in the milk.
4.	Lactose_percentage: Percentage of lactose content in the milk.
5.	Temperature: The temperature at which the milk was produced.
6.	Farm_id: Identifier for the farm producing the milk.
7.	Timestamp: The timestamp of milk production.
8.	Supplier_id: Identifier for the milk supplier.
9.	Locations: Geographical locations where the milk is produced.
10.	Environmental Conditions: Environmental factors during milk production.
11.	Batch_id: Identifier for the milk production batch.
12.	pH Level: The pH level of the milk.


Business Logic:
The project focuses on the following business scenarios:
•	Milk Categorization: The project includes a categorization mechanism that directs milk data to different dataframes based on the fat percentage range, Protein percentage range, Lactose percentage range, Temperature range from 62% to 72%.
Sr. No.	Milk Categorization	Fat percentage	Protein percentage	Lactose percentage
1.	Skimmed Milk	0.1% to 0.5%.	3 to 3.3%	4.5 to 4.7%
2.	Double Toned Milk	0.6% to 2.9%.	3.3% to 3.5%	4.8 to 5%
3.	Standardized Milk	3% to 5.9%.	3.6% to 3.9%	5.1 to 5.4%
4.	Full Cream Milk	6% to 9%	4% to 4.2%	5.5% to 5.8%

•	Location-based Data Segregation: The project analyzes milk data based on geographical locations to identify any regional variations in milk properties. This allows for the comparison of milk properties between different locations to understand the impact of location on milk quality. E.g  Koyana Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Prakriya Sangh Ltd., Karad have procurement area in karad (Karad and Navarasta Area) and patan cities (Patan , koyana).
•	Error Handling: An error handling mechanism is implemented to identify and redirect bad data to a separate dataframe for further analysis and data quality control. This ensures that any anomalies or inaccuracies in the data are isolated for inspection and corrective action.
•	Data Storage in HDFS and Hive Analysis: The processed data, categorized milk information, and location-based data are stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This enables seamless integration with Apache Hive, allowing for extensive analysis and querying using Hive's SQL-like interface. The stored data can be used to generate valuable insights and support business decisions.
•	Alert Email Generation: In case of the detection of bad data, an automated email alert is triggered to notify the manager. The email contains essential information about the detected bad data, enabling prompt action and ensuring data quality and integrity.

Methodology:
•	The project leverages PySpark, a distributed data processing framework, to handle real-time data streaming, processing, and analysis.
•	Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, is used as the message broker for data ingestion and transmission.
•	The data pipeline involves data streaming, transformation, filtering, and segregation using PySpark's DataFrame API.
•	Statistical analysis, classification techniques, and error handling mechanisms are applied to the milk properties data.

Potential Technology:
The "MilkPro Data Pipeline" utilizes the following technologies and methodologies:
1)	PySpark: A distributed data processing framework that handles real-time data streaming, processing, and analysis efficiently.
2)	Kafka: A distributed streaming platform used as the message broker for data ingestion and transmission, ensuring smooth and reliable data flow.
3)	Python: The programming language used for implementing data engineering and analysis tasks, making the project code readable and flexible.
4)	Data Streaming: Techniques for processing and analyzing data streams in real-time, enabling the pipeline to handle large volumes of milk properties data seamlessly.
5)	Data Analysis: Statistical analysis and classification techniques are applied to the milk properties data to derive valuable insights and patterns.
6)	Error Handling: Mechanisms are in place to identify and handle bad data, ensuring data quality and accuracy in downstream analysis.
Deliverables:

•	Analysis of the relationships between milk properties, including id, fat_percentage, protein_percentage, lactose_percentage, and temperature.
•	Insights and visualizations on quality control measures, enzymatic activity, and process optimization based on the analysis results.

Potential Challenges:
The project may encounter the following challenges:
•	Handling Real-time Data Streaming: Ensuring that the data pipeline efficiently processes and analyzes real-time data streams without delays or bottlenecks.
•	Efficient Classification Techniques: Implementing efficient classification techniques for accurately categorizing milk based on fat percentage and other properties.
•	Data Quality Issues: Addressing data quality issues and handling outliers or inaccuracies in the milk properties dataset to ensure the reliability of the analysis.
•	Performance Optimization: Optimizing the pipeline's performance to handle varying environmental conditions and scale as the data volume grows.
